Initializing Repository
-----------------------

Repo initialization :
    
    ## Releases Repo ##
    $ repo init -u https://github.com/BlissRoms-x86/manifest.git -b q-x86-12.1

sync repo :

    $ repo sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle -c
    
problems syncing? :

    $ repo sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --force-sync -c

Building
--------

PC builds (x86) explained:
	  
This script will allow you to build an x86 based .ISO for PCs as well as help you with a few other things. Please see details below

Usage :  

	$ build-x86 options buildVariants extraOptions addons

Options : 

	-c | --clean : Does make clean && make clobber and resets the device tree
	-s | --sync: Repo syncs the rom (clears out patches), then reapplies patches to needed repos
	-p | --patch: Just applies patches to needed repos
	-r | --proprietary: build needed items from proprietary vendor (non-public)

BuildVariants :

	android_x86-user : Make user build
	android_x86-userdebug |: Make userdebug build
	android_x86-eng : Make eng build
	android_x86_64-user : Make user build
	android_x86_64-userdebug |: Make userdebug build
	android_x86_64-eng : Make eng build

ExtraOptions : Defaults to None

	foss : packages microG & FDroid with the build
	fdroid : packages custom FDroid with the build (requires private sources)
	go : packages Gapps Go with the build (when go vendor is synced)
	gapps : packages OpenGapps with the build (when OpenGapps vendor sources are synced)
	gms : packages GMS with the build (requires private repo access)
	none : force all extraOption flags to false. (Drfault Option)

Addons : Requires "--proprietary" build to have run at least once. Defaults to None

	croshoudini : Include libhoudini from Chrome OS 
	croswidevine : Include widevine from Chrome OS
	crosboth : Include both libhoudini and widevine from Chrome OS
	crosnone : Do not include any of them. (Default Option)

Now For The Fun Stuff
-----------------------

To start, you must first use the -s (--sync) flag, then on following builds, it is not needed. 

You can do this two ways. Traditionally or using the build script. Point is, you must sync with the new manifest changes. 

Traditional way :

	$ repo sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --force-sync

Or using the build script :

	$ build-x86 -s

Initial extraction of the proprietary files from Google are also needed on the first build. 
Please note that this process will need to be run for x86 & x86_64 builds seperately (some cleanup may be needed). 

We are able to use the -r (--proprietary) flag for that. This step needs to be done once per device setup (x86 or x86_64) and we have it working on its own because
the image mounting process requires root permissions, so keep a look out for it asking for your root password. 
	  	  
Next step is to download the proprietary files from Google :

	$ build-x86 -r android_x86_64-userdebug 

After that, you can build your release file :

	$ build-x86 android_x86_64-userdebug foss crosboth (to build the userdebug version for x86_64 CPUs with FDroid & microG included)
